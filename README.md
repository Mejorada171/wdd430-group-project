***Project Summary***
We need to create a website called “Handcrafted Heaven”, where artisans and crafters can showcase and sell their handmade products. 

The platform will include seller profiles, product listings with images, prices, and descriptions, and a review and rating system so users can share feedback. 

 We need to focus on a good design, responsive layout, and easy navigation. The technologies we will use are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js for the front-end. Node.js and database for the backend.
